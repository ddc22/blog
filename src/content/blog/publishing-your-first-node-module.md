**Note:** This quick guide will walk you through the process of publishing your first Node.js module to the NPM registry.

This is a quick guide on publishing your very first node module to the NPM registry. Follow these straightforward steps to get your code published and available for others to use.

## Create an NPM Account and Login in Your Terminal

### Step 1: Create a Free NPM Account
Create a free NPM account at [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/) (remember the email, username, and password)

### Step 2: Login to NPM via Terminal
Open any terminal and login to this NPM account using:

```bash
npm login
```

You will be prompted to enter your username, password, and email address.

## Create Your Module

### Step 3: Create a New Folder and Initialize

```bash
mkdir my-first-module
cd my-first-module
npm init
```

Answer the prompts to generate your `package.json` file.

### Step 4: Create Your Module Code

Create an `index.js` file with your module's functionality:

```javascript
// index.js
function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

module.exports = {
  sayHello
};
```

### Step 5: Test Your Module Locally

Make sure your module works as expected before publishing.

## Publish Your Module

### Step 6: Check if the Package Name is Available

```bash
npm search your-package-name
```

### Step 7: Publish to NPM Registry

```bash
npm publish
```

If this is your first time publishing, you might need to:

```bash
npm publish --access=public
```

### Step 8: Verify Your Package

Visit `https://www.npmjs.com/package/your-package-name` to see your published module.

## Updating Your Module

### Step 9: Update Your Code

Make changes to your module's code.

### Step 10: Update the Version

```bash
npm version patch  # For bug fixes
npm version minor  # For new features
npm version major  # For breaking changes
```

### Step 11: Publish the Update

```bash
npm publish
```

Congratulations! You've published your first node module to the NPM registry. This opens the door to contributing to the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and tools that power modern web development.
