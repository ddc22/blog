## DDC - Full Stack Engineer

**Greetings!** I'm DDC, a passionate full stack engineer with over 9 years of experience building scalable web applications and services. I specialize in creating elegant, performant solutions across various domains including retail systems, e-commerce platforms, and marketing technology.

## Skills and Expertise

My technical toolkit spans both frontend and backend technologies. On the frontend, I'm proficient with **React**, **Redux**, **Angular**, **TypeScript**, and **Emotion CSS-in-JS** for building dynamic user interfaces. For backend development, I leverage **Java**, **Spring Framework/Boot**, **REST APIs**, and **NestJS**. I'm experienced with database technologies including **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Clickhouse** for analytics. My cloud infrastructure knowledge includes **AWS Lambda**, **ECS/Fargate**, **EventBridge**, and **S3/Firehose**.

## Professional Journey

### Automattic (2020-2025)
At Automattic, I worked on WordPress.com Growth projects where I architected component-based UIs with ReactJS/Redux for the plans page, leading to 47% improvement in purchase conversions and 50% reduction in support tickets. I led a 4-person team to deliver BuiltByWordpress Express service with dynamic pricing and multi-step onboarding.

My most challenging project was an AI Email Marketing Platform where I designed a unified interface for AI integrations (Anthropic-Claude and OpenAI-ChatGPT), built responsive frontends with ReactJS/TypeScript, and implemented event-based data pipelines integrating multiple sources with a customer segmentation engine. I worked with Clickhouse to build columnar efficient data stores for real-time analysis of email campaign performance.

### Enactor (2018-2020)
As a Senior Software Engineer at Enactor, I led an 8-person cross-border team building a React-based UI Layer for retail POS systems. We developed a modularized codebase using Lerna/webpack to facilitate decoupled logic and high cohesion. I also worked on an E-Commerce platform implemented from scratch using React, Flux, and Webpack.

### Avtra (2017-2018)
At Avtra, I focused on building passenger checkin systems and ticket booking platforms for the airline industry. I performed full stack development with primary involvement in backend technologies including Java 8, Spring Boot, and Spring Security.

### Virtusa (2016-2017)
I began my professional career at Virtusa developing an innovative dashboard platform with AngularJS frontend and Spring REST backend. I implemented and managed app integration using RabbitMQ and multiple disparate hosts and clients using AMQP protocols.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

One of my most significant technical challenges was building a hyper-personalized email system at Automattic. Working in a three-person team, I helped architect data pipelines to sync and process massive volumes of customer data from diverse sources. I built a scalable data validation layer as a serverless component and implemented an SQS queue system to manage high-volume data flow without loss. This directly contributed to our email personalization achieving approximately 18% lift over standard templates.

## Collaboration and Leadership

Throughout my career, I've grown from an individual contributor to a team leader who can both architect systems and help other developers succeed. At Enactor, I drove company-wide JavaScript/React knowledge discovery as a trainer and reviewer. At Automattic, I led multiple teams through high-velocity product changes while maintaining code quality and performance.

## Continuous Learning

I'm passionate about staying at the forefront of technology, constantly expanding my skill set across both frontend and backend domains. I find the most reward in building abstractions that solve complex problems in elegant waysâ€”whether that's component architectures, data pipelines, or API interfaces.
