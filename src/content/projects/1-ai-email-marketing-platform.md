**Project Overview:**
While at Automattic, I helped build a cutting-edge AI Email Marketing Platform that transformed how businesses connect with their customers. This platform leveraged artificial intelligence to create hyper-personalized email content and optimize campaign performance through real-time analytics.

## Objectives

1. Create a unified interface for AI content generation that works seamlessly with multiple AI providers
2. Build scalable data pipelines capable of processing high volumes of customer data from diverse sources
3. Develop a segmentation engine that could target specific customer groups with personalized messaging
4. Provide marketers with actionable, real-time analytics to measure campaign effectiveness

## Features

1. **AI Content Generation:**
   - Designed a unified interface for multiple AI integrations (Anthropic-Claude and OpenAI-ChatGPT)
   - Created an abstract class structure with vendor-specific adapters for consistent interaction across AI providers
   - Implemented templating system for AI-generated content with customizable variables

2. **Multi-Source Data Pipeline:**
   - Built serverless data validation components that processed data from HTTP-based pixels and webhook integrations
   - Implemented SQS queue system to manage high-volume data flow without loss
   - Developed a data enrichment layer that enhanced incoming data with identifying markers before storage

3. **Customer Segmentation Engine:**
   - Created a system to target specific customer groups based on behavior patterns and engagement history
   - Built flexible segmentation rules that marketers could combine for precise audience targeting
   - Integrated with existing customer databases for comprehensive profile development

4. **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Integrated Google Sheets with AppScripts for accessible, near real-time performance metrics
   - Implemented Clickhouse as our OLAP database for efficient columnar data storage and analysis
   - Created visualizations that tracked key performance metrics including open rates, click-through, and conversions

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** ReactJS, TypeScript, Redux for state management
- **Backend:** NestJS, PostgreSQL for transactional data, Clickhouse for analytics
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS Lambda, ECS/Fargate, EventBridge, S3/Firehose, SQS
- **Data Processing:** Event-based pipelines with secure data handling via KMS
- **AI Integration:** Custom abstraction layer for multiple AI provider APIs

## Outcome

The AI Email Marketing Platform significantly improved campaign effectiveness through personalization, achieving approximately 18% lift over standard variable-based email templates and maintaining email open rates around 30%. The serverless architecture successfully handled unpredictable volume spikes without performance issues, while the enrichment layer created more accurate customer profiles for targeting.
