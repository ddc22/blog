**Project Overview:**
At Enactor, I led an 8-person cross-border team that developed a React-based UI layer for the retail Point of Sale system. This innovative solution built on top of the existing Java-based Enactor retail framework backend, integrated via websockets to create a modern, infinitely customizable interface for retailers.

## Objectives

1. Create a modern, responsive UI for retail point of sale that improves on traditional POS interfaces
2. Develop a highly customizable React component system that retailers could configure to their specific needs
3. Integrate seamlessly with the existing Java backend while maintaining performance and reliability
4. Establish strong JavaScript testing practices and modular code architecture

## Features

1. **Customizable Component System:**
   - Built a flexible UI component library that retailers could configure to match their branding and workflow
   - Implemented context-based theming system for consistent styling across the application
   - Created pluggable transaction workflows that adapted to different retail scenarios

2. **Real-Time Integration:**
   - Developed websocket integration with the Java backend for real-time data synchronization
   - Implemented state management with Redux and thunk for predictable application behavior
   - Created offline capability for continued operation during connectivity interruptions

3. **Modular Codebase:**
   - Architected the application using Lerna/webpack to modularize the codebase
   - Facilitated decoupled logic and high cohesion between components
   - Implemented shared libraries for common functionality across modules

4. **Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Established strong JavaScript testing practices with JEST and testing-library
   - Created automated test suites for critical purchase flows
   - Implemented visual regression testing for UI components

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Redux, thunk, ES6
- **Build Tools:** Lerna, webpack, CRA
- **Testing:** JEST, testing-library
- **Backend Integration:** Websockets, Java

## Outcome

The team successfully delivered the first release to a major retailer in Denmark (JYSK), providing a fully realized and infinitely customizable React POS software. The modular architecture allowed for rapid customization to meet client-specific requirements while maintaining a high standard of code quality and performance.
